# time-2-go, *a shareable timer written on golang*
The idea of the Web App is dead-simple: it allows you to create a timer online, whose URL can be shared with others, who then will see a synchronized countdown. Also if you pause the timer, it pushes a signal to every client so they all get paused at the very same time.

Project goals are to learn Go programming language and real-time event based communication, as well as to practise TDD with a simple but clear problem to solve.

*Agilely created by a group of co-workers mainly during lunch breaks, with only a few hours of weekly dedication.*
